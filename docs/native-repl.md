# Native C++17 REPL

`clang-tracer-repl` manages a tracing session from one prompt. Commands start
an owned local server, attach to a process, upload C++ interceptor source, and
collect and inspect events. Ordinary C++ input runs locally through Clang
Interpreter. Python is not required to run the console.

## Build

The new console, its controller, generated RPC bindings and command parser are
compiled as C++17. The `c++17` base branch still selects C++20 for the existing
backend; the REPL does not inherit that requirement. Build the client alone on
Linux or macOS:

```sh
cmake -S . -B build-repl -G Ninja -DTRACER_REPL_ONLY=ON \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
  -DLLVM_DIR=/path/to/llvm/lib/cmake/llvm \
  -DClang_DIR=/path/to/llvm/lib/cmake/clang
cmake --build build-repl -j2
ctest --test-dir build-repl --output-on-failure
```

Supply a matching LLVM/Clang 21 or 22 development installation and gRPC/Protobuf
development packages and compiler plugin. The implementation has separate
embedding paths for LLVM 21.1.8 and 22.1.8. Set `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` for dependencies
outside the system search path. The existing full Linux build includes the REPL
by default; `-DTRACER_BUILD_REPL=OFF` keeps the prior backend-only build.

The two new dependency downloads have exact archive checksums:

| Package | Version | SHA256 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| replxx | 0.0.4, tag `release-0.0.4` | `a22988b2184e1d256e2d111b5749e16ffb1accbf757c7b248226d73c426844c4` |
| ANTLR C++ runtime | 4.13.2 | `0ed13668906e86dbc0dcddf30fdee68c10203dea4e83852b4edb810821bee3c4` |

Use `FETCHCONTENT_SOURCE_DIR_TRACER_REPLXX` and
`FETCHCONTENT_SOURCE_DIR_TRACER_ANTLR` with pre-extracted versions for offline
builds. Their licenses are installed with the console. gRPC and Protobuf use
the build's existing package selection; the REPL does not impose new versions.

Stage an installation without changing the live installation:

```sh
cmake --install build-repl --prefix "$PWD/build-repl/stage" --component Runtime
```

The runtime includes the facade header under `share/clang-tracer/repl/api.hpp`.
Clang/LLVM libraries, builtin headers and a compatible C++ SDK must remain
available. `--cpp-arg ARG` adds an interpreter compiler argument; repeat it for
include directories or other options. The prelude uses the build compiler's
standard-library include roots. Installing the client alone does not install a
Linux server or agent.

## Start and attach

On Linux x86-64 with the native server and agent installed:

```sh
clang-tracer-repl --attach 12345
# Optional explicit build-tree server:
clang-tracer-repl --server /path/to/build/clang-tracer-server --attach 12345
```

The console creates a private endpoint, starts its server in a separate process
session, waits for readiness, and attaches before returning to the prompt.
Agent discovery is performed by the server; `--agent PATH` is an override.
Server lookup checks an adjacent executable and then `PATH`.

For an existing server:

```sh
clang-tracer-repl --endpoint 127.0.0.1:50051 --attach 12345
```

An explicit endpoint, including `CLANG_TRACER_ENDPOINT`, connects to that service
and never silently starts a replacement. The PID belongs to the server host.
The existing tracing service's permissions and target/ABI restrictions apply.
The macOS client connects to a Linux server; it cannot start a Linux backend
locally.

With an owned local Linux server, `--process NAME` matches executable paths.
`%attach` without a PID opens the process picker; multiple matches require
choosing a displayed PID. `%processes --filter TEXT` lists local candidates.
Remote process enumeration is not in the service API, so remote attach uses an
explicit PID.

If an attach reply fails or times out, the operation may still finish on the
server. The console reports the endpoint, PID and newly observed candidate
session IDs, blocks automatic retries for that PID, and reconciles again on
`%status` and exit. Inspect `%sessions` and explicitly `%detach SESSION` when
appropriate. Candidates are never assumed to belong to this console on an
external server; recovery information is retained until explicitly resolved.

## Interceptor upload

```text
%server status
%sessions
%modules
%symbols --filter Calculator --limit 20
%probe resolve "Calculator::multiply(int, int) const"
%interceptor load method.cpp --as multiply_hook
%interceptor show multiply_hook
%interceptor upload multiply_hook --target "Calculator::multiply(int, int) const" --stack-depth 16
%probes
```

`load` reads the file on the console machine. `upload` sends its source by value
through ResolveProbe/AddProbe and reports success only for an active probe.
The draft remains available after deployment errors. The short equivalent is:

```text
%probe inject "Calculator::multiply(int, int) const" --callback method.cpp
```

Use `%interceptor edit NAME` for a multiline draft, `.end` to save, and `.cancel`
to discard. `%probe validate SELECTOR --callback FILE` requests validation.
Resolution/deployment options include `--include`, `--compdb`, `--module` and
repeatable `--compile-option`. Headers and compilation-database paths refer to
the server host. Source files are limited to 4 MiB. Uploaded interceptors are
compiled by the server/agent; local REPL variables, pointers and lambdas are not
implicitly transferred into the target.

## Collect and inspect

```text
%events
%collect --as live
%collect --count 100 --timeout 10 --as batch
%events list batch --limit 20
%events show batch --index 0
%events calls batch
%events stats batch
%record capture.pb --count 1000
%events open capture.pb --as saved
%events export saved --format json --output events.json
%events clear saved
```

`%events`, `%collect`, and `%record` run until Ctrl+C when no count is supplied.
Ctrl+C cancels the stream, returns to the prompt, and leaves probes and the
server running. Counted streams default to a 30-second total timeout; explicit
`--timeout` overrides it. Partial batches survive cancellation, timeout, or a
service error and report their completion state and last cursor.

Filter with `--probe ID`, `--phase PRE|POST`, repeatable `--name SELECTOR`,
`--session ID`, `--all`, and `--after CURSOR`. Selection defaults to the current
session. Name/session/sequence filters go to the service; probe and phase
filters are applied locally, and counts refer to matching events.

All named collections share the configured event-count and Protobuf resident
allocation budget (defaults: 4096 events, 64 MiB, plus bounded container overhead). A collecting ring
evicts its oldest events when full and reports local evictions separately from
agent/server loss counters. Existing named collections reserve their capacity;
clear them to make room. C++ snapshots keep their own shared references and can
retain events after the console releases them.
Collecting again under the same name releases that collection before receiving
new events. Offline replay requires an unused name or an explicit `%events clear`
first, so a corrupt recording cannot overwrite an existing capture.

Detail inspection shows typed arguments/results, receiver fields, stack frames,
and raw metadata. Shared-state payloads are decoded with their attached schema
when available. Native PRE/POST pairing includes server lifetime, session,
probe, thread and call identity, and marks missing halves. Shared-context
invocation/task identities remain available in event details.
Loss statistics sum the latest observed cumulative agent counter per probe and
server counter per server lifetime, without counting repeated samples twice.
Unknown native phases remain inspectable and are counted outside PRE/POST pairs.

Recordings use the Python client's four-byte little-endian length plus Protobuf
TraceEvent framing, with a 32 MiB per-frame limit. Recording and export create
new files exclusively. Replay rejects truncated headers/bodies and invalid
messages. A failed recording keeps its partial file; offline loading retains
only the configured bounded window. Use recording for long captures.

## Analyze in C++

```cpp
auto data = tracer.batch("batch");
data.size()
data.at(0).argument(0)
std::cout << data.at(1).result() << std::endl;
for (const auto &event : data) tracer.print(event);
auto captured_session = session;
auto more = tracer.collect(captured_session, 100, 10);
more.complete
more.timed_out
```

The prelude provides `tracer` and a selected-session reference named `session`.
Copying `session` makes a handle that retains that server/session identity;
later selection changes do not redirect it. Detached/stale handles fail before
tracing operations. The facade also provides `attach`, `inject`, and `detach`.
The interpreter initializes only for C++ input, so command-only startup does
not initialize Clang.

Use Ctrl+J for a newline within replxx's multiline editor, or `%cpp load FILE`
for a multiline source file. `%cpp reset` destroys C++ declarations and values
while preserving the tracing controller and sessions. Recoverable C++ input
errors leave commands available; use `%cpp reset` if later expressions still
fail after an interpreter error. Arbitrary native C++ runs with the console's
permissions and can terminate its process; it has no execution rollback or
guaranteed interruption. Ctrl+C cancellation applies to tracing operations.
Current completion covers command names; dynamic symbol and C++ semantic
completion are follow-up work.

## Cleanup and scripted use

```text
%probe remove 1
%detach
%server stop
%quit
```

Use the actual returned probe ID. Removing a probe reports restoration status.
EOF/quit detaches sessions this console created and stops only its owned server.
Selecting a pre-existing session does not transfer ownership. `%server stop`
waits for server restoration and is unavailable for an external service. A
shutdown timeout preserves the PID, endpoint and private directory for recovery;
the console never force-kills a restoring server.
On Linux, the owned server also receives a graceful termination signal if its
console dies unexpectedly, allowing it to restore hooks before exiting.

Piped input returns a nonzero status if any command or C++ input fails.
`--fail-fast` stops at the first failure and still performs cleanup. The parser
requires full-input acceptance and rejects malformed quotes, trailing garbage,
duplicate/conflicting options, integer overflow and invalid limits before
dispatch. Console commands use `%`; C++ input uses Clang's parser.

## Regenerate the grammar

The lexer/parser and visitor interfaces are generated from
`src/repl/TracerCommands.g4` with ANTLR 4.13.2. Generated sources ship with the
repository, so neither Java nor Python is needed to run the console.

```sh
scripts/regenerate-repl-parser.sh /path/to/antlr-4.13.2-complete.jar
scripts/regenerate-repl-parser.sh /path/to/antlr-4.13.2-complete.jar --check
```

The script verifies the jar's SHA256
`eae2dfa119a64327444672aff63e9ec35a20180dc5b8090b7a6ab85125df4d76`.
Set `TRACER_REPL_JAVA` to a Java executable when it is not on `PATH`. The
generated parser builds a typed command; semantic validation precedes execution.
Generated grammar actions never perform target operations.

## Validation

The native client was built and tested on macOS with LLVM 22.1.8 and on Linux
x86-64 with LLVM 21.1.8. All three client CTests pass on both hosts. A separate
real Linux integration check covers owned-server startup, PID/name attach,
interceptor deployment, live event collection/inspection, local C++ analysis,
recording/replay, probe restoration and cleanup. Staged installations on both
hosts evaluate C++ through the installed facade header. See
`NATIVE_REPL_PROGRESS.md` for evidence and the exact validation scope.
